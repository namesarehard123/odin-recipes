            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>       
                <li>Whisk water and egg together in a bowl until smooth. Combine bread crumbs, 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, oregano, basil, thyme, and garlic powder in a separate bowl.</li>
                <li>Dip each chicken breast in egg mixture, allowing excess egg to drip back into bowl. Coat each chicken breast in bread crumb mixture, shaking off excess.</li>
                <li>Repeat dipping each coated chicken breast in egg mixture and the bread crumb mixture for a double-coating and place in the prepared baking dish. Spray breaded chicken breasts with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour spaghetti sauce over each chicken breast and top each with mozzarella cheese and remaining Parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Continue baking until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the cheeses are melted, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Sever over pasta.</li>
            </ol>
